# This script downloads and installs whatever we need, e.g. FastQC
## The things too complicated to download we can just ask the user to deal with through links in README
## I called it A_[] because it comes first and data input is now done in the main file


# Install requirements:

# MAIN : gitpython, biopython and the SRA Toolkit
# Quality_Check : fastqc and multiqc
# Trimming : cutadapt
